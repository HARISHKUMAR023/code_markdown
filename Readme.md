# Markdown Code Snippet Generator

This tool allows you to create Markdown formatted code snippets. You can input a title, description, and the code snippet itself. The tool will generate the Markdown version of your code snippet, which you can preview and download as a Markdown file. This is particularly useful for developers who want to share their code in a readable and standardized format.

## How to Use
